# Task #2: Integration Strategy

## Integration of Visualization Tool into a Larger Codebase

To integrate this visualization tool into a larger codebase, I would extract the core components (`Main`, `Header`, `Footer`) and custom hooks (`useTriviaData`, `useFilters`) as reusable modules, exposing them through a well-defined API with TypeScript interfaces. The main challenges include: **UI consistency** – ensuring SCSS styles don't conflict with the parent application's design system (solution: use CSS modules or scoped styling); **performance** – Recharts may cause re-render issues with large datasets (solution: implement memoization and virtual scrolling); **data structure** – the current `Question` interface is tightly coupled to the Trivia API (solution: create adapter patterns for different data sources); **dependency management** – React 19 and Recharts version conflicts with existing packages; and **state management** – the tool's local state may need integration with Redux/Context API in larger applications. Proper prop-drilling elimination and API abstraction layers would be essential.
